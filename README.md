For Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course. This is the week 4 assignment. 

This is a repo for the Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Project on Coursera. 
The repo contains everything needed for the assignment:
	 R code, a codebook, and a tidy data set.  

##Files in the Repo:
Codebook.md describes how to use everything in the repo. It also descibes the
data, variables, and transformations to clean the data.

This code can be used by importing it into R or RStudio. 

tidyData.txt is the output of the R script. As the name suggests, it is a tidy
